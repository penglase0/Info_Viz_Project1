I also wish that one could rewind/repeat a certain part of what is being read, or be able to jump to different areas on a page.  It's an all or nothing thing right now.

As for using the e-books, the website seems unstable.  I have had many problems.  Sometimes my books don't work, meaning can't open them, and sometimes when I'm trying to highlight a certain text to copy for my personal notes, it is very difficult.  ",1

Logging in opens a new tab, going to platform2 opens a new tab and going to iLrn opens a new tab, and that is all just very silly.

Also, trying to get to iLrn opens a page with just the key, which has a link to ""Access"" which opens a new tab, which I then have to find the link that will bring me to the login page (because clicking ""Access"" brings me to what is essentially a service that I've already paid for??) and clicking sign in opens yet another tab. 
What I'm trying to say is that your website is unnecessarily complicated.

R_ekVJ4OK8KhZkDKh,11/30/18 17:12,1,1 wrong answer means having to redo entire page instead of one part of one question. It doesn't save correct answers forces you to complete answers you already got right along with the one part you didn't.,2

So, books, computers, etc. costs are out-of-balance.   ***2) I talked to publisher1 (excellent customer service) at least half-a-dozen times about taking a text (like I used in on-site labe 20 years ago) and making an e-book by simply adding video, quizzes, etc.  Today's students will not memorize an 800-pp. book (nor should they be expected to do so) about computers !  My quote:  ""Anything that you learn about computers today will have changed yesterday.:  Special note:  Microsoft made a wonderful addition to Office apps -- ""Tell me what you want to do"" ON THE RIBBON.

R_TonMUXTlHTrF6PT,3/5/20 12:04,2,"1. It's not a bank account so i don't  see the need to constantly logging me out of my account while i doing my homework. It takes a lot of time to log in back to my account, find the chapter, and the specific place i was at the time publisher1 decided to log me out, it is especially crucial when i have couple of minutes left before the due date/time. This ruins the entire experience for me, and i don't even see the need to do so, who would possibly need my textbook, my daughter can hack into it and read something?? Also, i only get the ""textbook"" for the duration of my semester, and sometimes i would like to go back and read or refer to my textbook even after my class is finished. There's definitely enough stress with school, but reading your textbook, or following directions in the chapter without the application constantly logging me out should not be one of them, too much stress, and it takes time to get the concentration back!

R_ROB5acy1TawrSCZ,9/24/20 3:41,10,Because I hate online school books and for some reason I was never a big fan of it because I am a hands on learner. Therefore I would need to touch what I am reading in order to successfully learn my schooling material. Ever since I have came across this material I have found it user friendly in a sense to where a non so every day tech person would not find it that complicated to maneuver etc. Another reason for my score is because you all have brought the physical learning aspects to as close to what anyone could ever thing of. I love how you can highlight what you are reading as you go because that is exactly what I do as I read. And lastly I love how the online school book website publisher1 offers a automated reader. It is convenient as a online student to utilize during their studies simply for the fact that many of us like my self get side track often so it is helpul to have someone read it out like a audiobook so it can be easier to read and retain information. The app basically replicates the desktop version so its nice to have the app and read the course material while I am in bed. I don't like always studying on my laptop and computer and the app creates a user a high speed friendly experience with the up to date technology services being rendered.  I always pay attention to aesthetics. I believe that is what separates Micrsosoft from their competitors is their beautiful cutting edge technology that makes you want to stare at it. Since I am always on the computer I have for some reason the layout of the page/website will determine my mood for a split second because of what I perceived. For instance I think Ebay has a terrible software layout their business consumer page. It is plain and has looked like that since the time I can remember. I feel like I am going to get my credit card information taken away etc. It doesn't feel welcoming to me. Imagine driving in a city and you decide to visit the most expensive side of the town and also visit the poorest. Because then you will notice many other large and important factors as to why we perceived what we saw. It is the same concept to me.

R_OPwLv2iaupyzQKl,2/18/21 10:28,1,"Evidence does not support the repetitious presentation of multiple choice questions around a few key terms as a meaningful way for people to learn this content outside of recollection of the definition of the key term itself. There is no contextual or functional application of these concepts in a way that would support the generalization of understanding the concept across contexts, nor does the exclusive focus on identifying terms support understanding how those concepts relate in complex psychological processes in the real world. Most significantly, the material presented is all over the place--I cannot emphasize that enough--In a way that is profoundly unhelpful to students. There is significant focus on concepts that are not scientifically validated and/or not currently in widespread use within the field of psychology, and while it is important for academic psychologists to understand the history of the discipline it is unhelpful and confusing for introductory students to be exposed to concepts that they will never likely encounter again (because they are outdated or debunked), unless the student chooses to pursue a career as a psychology professor, which very few will. There are also a number of factual errors in the material--for example, enuresis was presented in a module on sleep when it is not a sleep disorder but an elimination disorder; the 'correct' answer on a quiz was that the difference between ""molly"" and MDMA is that ""molly is the purified form of MDMA"" which is demonstrably false given that MDMA is the literal name of the psychoactive substance.

Options include open straight to dashboard, have a split option screen between the shop and the dashboard, or have a big DASHBOARD button. 

Secondly, I was dissatisfied by the print options available. I was under the assumption I would receive a cheap packet of printouts of the book. Instead I learned we could not mark them up in anyway, and had to return them. Returning them is somewhat understandable but the fact we cannot mark them up makes me fear you will make us pay for ""marking them up"" (taking notes).

8.) Which of the following is often one of the most overlooked but extremely important steps in transition planning?
a. Reviewing the outcome of the transition.	
b. Writing the transition plan.	
c. Setting goals.	
d. Developing a planning team.

Written transition plans help keep the team focused and prevent steps from being overlooked or forgotten (Minor, 2002).

1. When searching for a product, there is an option to buy the e-version in spite of having it already though the product2 access. This brings up confusion if I need to buy it to be able to access it.

2. when searching for a word, I couldn't find a way to search for a word within the textbook or within a chapter.

3. Opening more than one window at the same time: 
- platform1 and textbook (improve the visibility of both contents)
- textbook and another textbook (provides changes of reading from two books regarding the same content)

4. Easy access to the provided resources: 
there is no easy way to find the ppt material, videos, and other resources that are available for the students. 

5. Better reader software: 
It will be ideal to have a better reader software of the book. 
The reader is monotone, pronunciation is incorrect in some words ( ex. HR humans will spell it, the software pronounce it harrr), it makes the material harder to understand. 
It reads the copyright publisher1, it reads the little lines... it reads it all. I think it can be improved.

6. Having more human videos and audio:
This will be ideal wherever the content gets explained by a human will enhance the products in 300%.

Thank you for giving (users) the opportunity to express our thoughts. I am sure this will help improve the product performance ensuring you have more sales of it as well.

Best.

One final thought I have is that I found it hard to navigate the website and the help center specifically because I would've been okay with all of the other problems I have had with this subscription if I was simply allowed access to other books without an access code or class code because without one it is extremely difficult and maybe impossible to get access to the other resources I need on this website.

1. On the college Book Store side they were not very familiar with the product and their instructions were not as clear as they could have been. The relationship between Red Shelf, my Bookstore and publisher1 was unclear making it very hard to troubleshoot. 2.   All avenues of support were inadequate I could not get a live person on the phone and had two email Red Shelf  they responded but never really read my email and pointed me back to publisher1.  I did eventually connect with a publisher1 employee over the phone  but there was no resolution for my problem.  I was trying to order rental books and was told that I may only rent one book at 7.99 from Product1 the rest were full price rentals...This is not what was advertised to me.  In addition my school is not even setup correctly to allow me to order the rentals I need so- to this day I still do not have the rental books and am struggling because I like E-books but for somethings it is helpful to have the text when your trying to work out problems because the e-books are sometimes a little hard to navigate and I do a lot of flipping back and forth and it slows me down.  feel free to help me with my rentals if you can I canbe contacted at email

Its completely ridiculous you charge this much for a GARBAGE program. God forbid you want to go to a specific page of the book, you'll spend 5 minutes getting redirected, waiting for it to load for a full minute or two for it finally to place you on the wrong page, sometimes the wrong chapter! You do this for 10 minutes before you finally give up and start at the first page of the chapter and going page by page in agonizingly slow loading times to get to the page you are looking for. Then while doing your problems, assuming you aren't a genius who knows everything already and actually a student, you try to go back to the book page for help just to take anotehr 15 minutes flipping back and forth as the page freaks out and goes up and down and up and down and up and down.

R_2uTIOxyE4GHW25Q,2/6/19 11:54,3,"I had trouble adding several books to my home page. Sometimes it let me, others times it didn't, it was a hassle. When I looked up a book sometimes it prompted to upgrade, even though I was already signed in to my account and had entered my publisher1 code, and other times it prompted to add to home. I took several times for me to get that option again for the other products I had to add, I had to sign in and out several times. This took about two hours. Another thing is that when I went to go register another product some teachers didn't have it linked to blackboard and one didn't give us a class code so that was another hassle and it took me forever to find the product. I went to the regular search and I saw the book, but again it prompted to upgrade and it eventually gave me the option to add to my home options. Once I finally got that done every time I  tried to access my dashboard/ home page it just told me it was loading and nothing would pop up. I spent almost all day refreshing it, and it was just say it was loading. Today, I signed back it and the books finally appeared. Overall, publisher1 is a great opportunity for college students to save money and it offers several books and tools for our use which is get, but it has a lot to improve on (mostly on the way it is set up). I would suggest that when registering the product the option of searching for a book should be maybe through the access code given by the professor, title, or ISBN. That would make it easier than having us to type an entire link that the professor may not even provide to the students.  Plus, I watched the video and that wasn't very helpful because it wasn't taking the access code my professor gave us, so i didn't know what to do. Another thing I would suggest is making more clear how we could use the other functions publisher1 offers, other than access to the others books, it is unclear to me how to access the rest of it such the study tools for product3 and study guides.",2

R_3G1yDhGxbdHvN1Y,11/5/18 20:50,3,"I have been using publisher1 for 3 semesters straight, and from the first week of use, it was clear it had major problems. The system is very buggy and slow. It lags on my relatively new macbook, and it is a pain to use. The implementation of the feature which signs you out of publisher1 after a few minutes of not using it is also a pain as it takes way too long and way too many steps for me just to go back to the page or the number I was in after just a few minutes off my computer. I suggest making the logout period longer. The e-book system is also very confusing as it not a 1:1 replica of the physical book, which would have been much easier to use and much easier go follow through in class. I would find myself borrowing the book in the library instead of using the e-book that I have in publisher1 due to the lack of page numbers and the different way/layout of the pages. I would rather a pdf version of the book if they'd have one than going through the catastrophe which is publisher1. Also, the search feature which, otherwise would be useful, has massive bugs which makes it impossible to use. How slow this feature works is a joke, and the time for it to actually work takes way too long and is way too buggy. This feature would have been useful if it actually worked especially with the lack of a page number in the e-books. I spent quite alot of money for publisher1, especially for a college student, and I expected much more from a product that could otherwise be great if given much needed improvements. ",2

R_eDQEKGpvw9eibiF,1/24/19 9:11,5,"I have provided a lot of Feedback for you because I had a pretty rough start.  I am a CIS major So I understand some of the challenges your technical teams are having when they are building a web interface for these books.  All my feedback was intended to be honest and constructive I don't intend for it to be Snarky..If e-books were easy everyone would be selling so please I provided this feedback with only constructive intentions not to tear anybody down or demean your product . 
I'm non traditional student and had high expectations when I put out the cost for a 1 year subscription.  I was excited because I could get E-books and text copy rentals at a good price.  Unfortunately after calling Product1 and finding out it is 1 rental  per semester I am a little concerned because I am struggling without the rentals. I have considered returning the this product 3-4 times and going to hard copies but hate the thought of only having a text copy because E-copies do have some advantages.        The Biggest problem has been lack of coordination between the bookstore, publisher1 and Red Shelf.  If my kid was going through all this I would have thought she was making it up. After working through the struggle I might not be willing to spend the money for this product on her behalf unless she absolutely wanted e-books because there is a lot that is challenging about your product.   If I compare your service to Amazon or Barnes and Noble (which I have used for years) I was never confronted with these kinds of issues.  Another thing that I find challenging is that the e-book search feature interfaces are different between my books the one book has a very clunky search feature  the other book seems to be more streamlined.   I also hate the fact that it is hard to get the page number and contents in either book.My teachers are assigning homework based on page numbers.   Initially I thought the pages in one book were showing incorrectly but That could have been user error on my part. In some cases the e-book interfaces are not as intuitive as they could be and are making it harder to work on my homework(Reading works great but flipping back and forth slows me down a little bit)    Compare that experience to using a pdf file where the pages are always right and you can use it between multiple devices with ease there are different ways to flip pages ( I feel like pdfs are designed a little more intuitively.  I know that for copyright reasons you are trying to keep the PDF files out of the hands of pirates but as paying customer the experience would be more consistent and familiar which would  ultimately have made me a lot happier. Hopefully my feedback is valuable to you.   I don't hate your product but I don't love it either.  If you were to ask me would I recommend it to a friend -  I would if they really wanted E-books  but I would warn them that Support needs improvement and some of the books do not flow as smooth as they do with the NOOK or the Kindle but they are usable if you really had to rely upon them.  One last note If you can help me with my rental situation that would be great â€¦.Thanks for your time feel free to contact me:   email",1

To say I'm not happy would be the understatement of the century!!!  I called the customer service number to be placed on hold for over an hour before I actually got to speak with a representative, only to be told to hold again for another 30 mins while he tried to figure out why I hadn't received my book. Then when he returns the rep tells me that the book that I had already been charged for had never been shipped because ""the computer system didn't think I needed the book because I purchaced the online version"". I was told that they would fix the problem and they would express ship my book to me by Wednesday this week, (September 5, 2018). Today is Friday September the 7th and I have yet to receive my book, again.....

I will be talking with my professor to get some assistance, but I was rather lost when it came to the book for help. 
Overall, I don't hate publisher1 (or publisher1. publisher1 allowed me to save almost $1000 on books, so I am very happy it is an option) but there are a few things that would make using your platform far less frustrating.

I received my book list after signing up for classes, saw that I had a lot of publisher1 related courses, and remembered from my first semester that you guys offered publisher1. I then purchased the pass from the store.",4

It's sooooo frustrating I hate this program. It's so much easier to use connect to read and highlight. This program makes it harder to have all highlighting stay put. Not to mention the app has less options for usage compared to the book.

The library could be downloaded to a computer, then account credentials checked periodically instead of having to access the internet every time I need to access my text book.

I think that textbooks that cost hundreds of dollars are ridiculous. This is especially since they're digital, and have DRM that limited how I read them. I can't read your textbooks on the eReader apps I like. I've tried your platform1 mobile app, and it doesn't have a good reading experience like other eReaders. Your Product1 rental textbook doesn't really help, costing an additional $7. It may not seem like much, but I see right through your sneaky marketing tactics and won't fall for that. MineTap is also buggy and annoying to use in my opinion. I also don't like that it often automatically logs me out, requiring me to go back to your homepage, login, navigate to my dashboard, open platform1, and go back into the activity I was in the middle of in, which altogether takes about five minutes on the slow internet at my house.

My school does not use that and so I was not able to rent a paper copy. For one class, I was forced to pay another $50 to rent the paper copy of the textbook for my one class.

For starters, I am a student at YVRCA and I am dually enrolled into DCCC (hence why I'm even in publisher1). In doing this, I have recently had to take a WEB-110 class through publisher1, an expense at which wasn't covered by the school. Having to spend ~$100 at a high school level is a rather big deal, as it weighs in at just slightly more than my school fees altogether. However, despite this reservation, I do find that publisher1 has offered a tremendous amount of study resources and external assistance that were all bundled into that price. Moreover, publisher1 also provides me with a direct connection between my studies and whatever the instructor lays out for me. While I do wish some of the assignments could be constructed differently, and the books could be more thoroughly linked to the coursework, my experience with publisher1 has been a wonderful one. I have enjoyed publisher1 and its services in aggregation and I look forward to any future courses I have through it. ",1

I carefully followed the instructions, but it did not work.  So I called to get tech support. The wait times are super long.  And every time I called, I heard something new that conflicted with what the previous rep told me.   Same is true for other questions I've had.  (Same is true of faculty & staff at my school)  They don't know that they are suppose to provide us with links, nor how to provide us with links. So we can't use the offline feature I was promised.  The other students don't know either.  Nobody is sure about how it works. 

After numerous calls & long wait times, I get help in finding, selecting & uploading my books to ""My Home"".  

But when I was ready to do my homework in the middle of the night, all my books had disappeared from my account!  When I searched for them to reselect & re-add to my account, I either couldn't find the books, or I could see the title & image of the book, but couldn't select it to load to ""My Home"".  It's been a confusing & challenging experience.  

Also, some of the books disappeared from my platform1 account.  And although I have now re-uploaded the books, it does not recognize that I re-loaded the last book.  It is not obvious how to add the book to platform1 Account from my phone.  I pressed all the buttons, one add a time, but can't figure it out (I pretty computer savvy/use them all day long).  I'm resisting the long wait times for tech support, so i still need help downloading the book to my account on platform1. 

But I like the idea of publisher1, in theory.  Getting started & stability - a nightmare!  

But I love the ReadSpeaker feature.  Extremely helpful, except if you are taking notes & want to go back &  repeat something, you can't go backwards. 

My experience with the Tech Support was good - warm, willingness to help & professionalism, but It just feels like they are not trained well. They don't really know the system well. ",1

Now sometimes it is easy to search for this or that but other times it harder.  It makes it that much harder because I have an instructor that loves to mask questions from the picture example descriptions.  There are times your search engine will point you to them and other's it stays silent.  being that I am more of a non-tradtional student, also working it cost me time, so, I probably pay far more attention to this than the more traditional students do.

R_2w6ocgUjg4ORwsN,1/14/19 16:53,1,Its annoying; i have like 15 tabs open because every time i click a new tab opens; the ebooks suck. i cant tell my classmates where i found something because my book has no page numbers and i cant tell where they found things because again no page numbers. There are no options for book layouts. I dont like scrolling like its an article. there is no full screen option so even if the book did go by page numbers I wouldnt be able to see all of it. The homework part of it sucks- the instructions are unclear. for organic chemistry you have to draw out of the structure of everything which is terrible when you have a molecule with 18 carbons and a few VERY common functional groups. I hate it. I regret my purchase. ,2

In addition the mobile version of the book (the app) is broken and does not show equations properly. Most likely it is an encoding issue when displaying the text and is easy to fix but since it has not been fixed in a semester I wouldnt hold my breath. Also platform1 books dont have page numbers (dont know whats up with that). If you want to know what makes a learning platform good. Take a look at hawks learning. For math it is 100x better than anything you guys have made becuase of how they ensure that you have learned the lesson. While For these books its just that a book not a learning platform. You guys are litterally doing the bare-minimum and in some cases cant even meet that. Improve the books and the learning platform and then maybe you have an ok product. Now divide the price of all books by at least 2. Then maybe you have a good learning platform. I mean I hear people in class saying how much they hate your products or having to use your books in almost every class that I am in. So I know I am not alone here.,1

R_2qaSuT9bFwK1o31,11/18/18 17:23,4,"The structure of the ACCT 101A course does not set the student up for success, but failure. Each chapter is split up into three parts, a pre-lecture which introduces general topics of the chapter prior to the class meeting, a homework section which takes the longest of the three that focuses on a few elements of the chapter, and a cumulative exam. The pre-lecture and the exam can only be attempted once. The homework can be attempted 5 times. The content of the pre-lectures are accompanied by video tutorials and learning objectives, but since the concepts in the new chapter are just being introduced, mistakes can still be made. I am not certain why the pre-lectures are not given the same amount of attempts as the homework for the chapter. The homework is split up into several parts. Each part has an accompanying video tutorial through the first few chapters. Eventually, the video tutorials become less frequent the student is forced to depend on class notes and textbook resources in order to succeed. The textbook resources are far less specific and far more general in demonstrating the desired task, reducing the success of the student. There is also a ""check my work"" option that tells the student which prompts they got correct/incorrect. This is a fickle option as if the page accidentally reloads or if the student spends enough time looking at other questions in the homework, the input on what they got correct/incorrect disappears. I had several times where I would look back to another question to check if my method was the same for a similar problem only to find that the feedback for the entire problem disappeared. This reduced my feedback opportunities by one. The chapter exams have several problems. The question number is arbitrarily set to 20. The time is arbitrarily set to one hour. Some chapters cover subjects that take far less than an hour to complete, others have questions that can only be answered after doing several steps of calculations which take a considerable amount of time. Additionally the questions in the exam deal with both working through problems and answering short multiple choice questions. The only source of the answer for these multiple choice questions are from the pre-lecture, in-class lectures, and the extra practice problems that publisher1 does not require. The majority of each exam explores concepts students are not required to learn or merely briefly looked over. The homework hardly prepares the students for the exam. Finally, the timer is sometimes inconsistent. I've had 2 exams where it stopped me from working and said that time expired when the timer displayed 20 minutes remaining. Finally, publisher1 allows no late work instead of some form of grade reduction. This screws over students who are working to make a living while at school who have very brief windows of time to get things done. If something like the internet goes out after a time where they can go use public internet somewhere, they are screwed out of points that they could have gotten and would have gotten had the issue not occurred. The student then gets no credit for an entire week of homework when they could get partial credit for a more reasonable late work system such as -10% every day an assignment is late.

If these issues were fixed, I think publisher1 would be a wonderful standard for online homework based on the content itself. As is, it sets the student up for failure by not requiring practice with what they need to know for each exam, and it is plagued with technical glitches that reduce the amount of points a student can earn if they occour.",2

I hope that you take this as a criticism from one student who is brand new to college, and no  I am not super young fresh out of high school but I am also still not entirely out of the loop either. Therefore I feel as though it could use improvements for us who are a little bit not up to date with specific technological obstacles I found myself in last semester. I do hope to see some videos with specific how to demonstrations because their are tons of posts i see in forums through my canvas site of those who actually have no idea of what they are really doing. But other than that glad that all my course materials were able to be fulfilled here through your company publisher1, and I will say that the year subscription through your site specifically saved me tons of money this new semester and I still have a bit of ways to go before my year runs out. So thank you a bunch because I was able to spoil my kids for last years christmas with student credit card and this semester got to pay back more than half of that just due to the amount saved on materials needed for my classes this spring semester. So again thank you so much for that now just extra helps with login for new students or for new or extra materials courses we take if we do publisher1 subscriptions vs. publisher1 required course subscriptions via school req.

I have been in a number of classes where students could not afford books, so they tried to complete the class without books. Fewer people are attending colleges, most for financial reasons. Imagine the advantage a school would have if they could advertise that each year students pay a flat fee of less then $200 for all their books. I also believe the publisher2 monopoly has to end. I just finished a semester assisting a professor and we discovered that the publisher2 text book and materials she used had no flow, similar topics were all over the chapter so you needed to jump back in forth, there were also topics that needed to be taught together, but instead they were presented in different sections of the book. The worst issue was the quiz bank, the questions were developed to trick the students by changing only one word and some of the topics were never even covered in the current chapter. Students need to be encouraged by working hard and doing well on their exams, publisher2â€™s quiz bank is made up of poorly written questions that only frustrate the students.

It got stuck on some payment page of some third-party company I forgot the name of. I contacted them, who never responded. Two of the times I tried let me get passed the PayPal stage, but each time returned me to your website saying that there was a payment error. I went to my PayPal account to see two pending transactions for $120. Thankfully, they never actually charged from my account, but just stayed pending for a while. Contacting PayPal about it didn't work. Then, I had trouble logging into my publisher1 account! None of the buttons on your login page were responding. I had a chat with one of your support agents, who said to clear my browser cookies. That worked somehow. When I tried paying again, the transaction eventually went through. I'd say I'll never make a purchase via publisher1 again, but then I said that last semester too. I don't know why my classes keep requiring you.",3
