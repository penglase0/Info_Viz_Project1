Logging in opens a new tab, going to platform2 opens a new tab and going to iLrn opens a new tab, and that is all just very silly.

Also, trying to get to iLrn opens a page with just the key, which has a link to ""Access"" which opens a new tab, which I then have to find the link that will bring me to the login page (because clicking ""Access"" brings me to what is essentially a service that I've already paid for??) and clicking sign in opens yet another tab.

560,R_ROB5acy1TawrSCZ,2020-09-24 03:41:00,10,Because I hate online school books and for some reason I was never a big fan of it because I am a hands on learner. Therefore I would need to touch what I am reading in order to successfully learn my schooling material. Ever since I have came across this material I have found it user friendly in a sense to where a non so every day tech person would not find it that complicated to maneuver etc. Another reason for my score is because you all have brought the physical learning aspects to as close to what anyone could ever thing of. I love how you can highlight what you are reading as you go because that is exactly what I do as I read. And lastly I love how the online school book website publisher1 offers a automated reader. It is convenient as a online student to utilize during their studies simply for the fact that many of us like my self get side track often so it is helpul to have someone read it out like a audiobook so it can be easier to read and retain information. The app basically replicates the desktop version so its nice to have the app and read the course material while I am in bed. I don't like always studying on my laptop and computer and the app creates a user a high speed friendly experience with the up to date technology services being rendered.  I always pay attention to aesthetics. I believe that is what separates Micrsosoft from their competitors is their beautiful cutting edge technology that makes you want to stare at it. Since I am always on the computer I have for some reason the layout of the page/website will determine my mood for a split second because of what I perceived. For instance I think Ebay has a terrible software layout their business consumer page. It is plain and has looked like that since the time I can remember. I feel like I am going to get my credit card information taken away etc. It doesn't feel welcoming to me. Imagine driving in a city and you decide to visit the most expensive side of the town and also visit the poorest. Because then you will notice many other large and important factors as to why we perceived what we saw. It is the same concept to me.

There is no contextual or functional application of these concepts in a way that would support the generalization of understanding the concept across contexts, nor does the exclusive focus on identifying terms support understanding how those concepts relate in complex psychological processes in the real world. Most significantly, the material presented is all over the place--I cannot emphasize that enough--In a way that is profoundly unhelpful to students. There is significant focus on concepts that are not scientifically validated and/or not currently in widespread use within the field of psychology, and while it is important for academic psychologists to understand the history of the discipline it is unhelpful and confusing for introductory students to be exposed to concepts that they will never likely encounter again (because they are outdated or debunked), unless the student chooses to pursue a career as a psychology professor, which very few will. There are also a number of factual errors in the material--for example, enuresis was presented in a module on sleep when it is not a sleep disorder but an elimination disorder; the 'correct' answer on a quiz was that the difference between ""molly"" and MDMA is that ""molly is the purified form of MDMA"" which is demonstrably false given that MDMA is the literal name of the psychoactive substance.

8.) Which of the following is often one of the most overlooked but extremely important steps in transition planning?
a. Reviewing the outcome of the transition.	
b. Writing the transition plan.	
c. Setting goals.	
d. Developing a planning team.

Written transition plans help keep the team focused and prevent steps from being overlooked or forgotten (Minor, 2002).

1. When searching for a product, there is an option to buy the e-version in spite of having it already though the product2 access. This brings up confusion if I need to buy it to be able to access it.

2. when searching for a word, I couldn't find a way to search for a word within the textbook or within a chapter.

3. Opening more than one window at the same time: 
- platform1 and textbook (improve the visibility of both contents)
- textbook and another textbook (provides changes of reading from two books regarding the same content)

4. Easy access to the provided resources: 
there is no easy way to find the ppt material, videos, and other resources that are available for the students. 

5. Better reader software: 
It will be ideal to have a better reader software of the book. 
The reader is monotone, pronunciation is incorrect in some words ( ex. HR humans will spell it, the software pronounce it harrr), it makes the material harder to understand. 
It reads the copyright publisher1, it reads the little lines... it reads it all. I think it can be improved.

6. Having more human videos and audio:
This will be ideal wherever the content gets explained by a human will enhance the products in 300%.

Thank you for giving (users) the opportunity to express our thoughts. I am sure this will help improve the product performance ensuring you have more sales of it as well.

Best.

1. On the college Book Store side they were not very familiar with the product and their instructions were not as clear as they could have been. The relationship between Red Shelf, my Bookstore and publisher1 was unclear making it very hard to troubleshoot. 2.   All avenues of support were inadequate I could not get a live person on the phone and had two email Red Shelf  they responded but never really read my email and pointed me back to publisher1.  I did eventually connect with a publisher1 employee over the phone  but there was no resolution for my problem.  I was trying to order rental books and was told that I may only rent one book at 7.99 from Product1 the rest were full price rentals...This is not what was advertised to me.  In addition my school is not even setup correctly to allow me to order the rentals I need so- to this day I still do not have the rental books and am struggling because I like E-books but for somethings it is helpful to have the text when your trying to work out problems because the e-books are sometimes a little hard to navigate and I do a lot of flipping back and forth and it slows me down.  feel free to help me with my rentals if you can I canbe contacted at email

When I looked up a book sometimes it prompted to upgrade, even though I was already signed in to my account and had entered my publisher1 code, and other times it prompted to add to home. I took several times for me to get that option again for the other products I had to add, I had to sign in and out several times. This took about two hours. Another thing is that when I went to go register another product some teachers didn't have it linked to blackboard and one didn't give us a class code so that was another hassle and it took me forever to find the product. I went to the regular search and I saw the book, but again it prompted to upgrade and it eventually gave me the option to add to my home options. Once I finally got that done every time I  tried to access my dashboard/ home page it just told me it was loading and nothing would pop up. I spent almost all day refreshing it, and it was just say it was loading. Today, I signed back it and the books finally appeared. Overall, publisher1 is a great opportunity for college students to save money and it offers several books and tools for our use which is get, but it has a lot to improve on (mostly on the way it is set up). I would suggest that when registering the product the option of searching for a book should be maybe through the access code given by the professor, title, or ISBN. That would make it easier than having us to type an entire link that the professor may not even provide to the students.  Plus, I watched the video and that wasn't very helpful because it wasn't taking the access code my professor gave us, so i didn't know what to do. Another thing I would suggest is making more clear how we could use the other functions publisher1 offers, other than access to the others books, it is unclear to me how to access the rest of it such the study tools for product3 and study guides.",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1-5,positive

The system is very buggy and slow. It lags on my relatively new macbook, and it is a pain to use.

I suggest making the logout period longer. The e-book system is also very confusing as it not a 1:1 replica of the physical book, which would have been much easier to use and much easier go follow through in class. I would find myself borrowing the book in the library instead of using the e-book that I have in publisher1 due to the lack of page numbers and the different way/layout of the pages. I would rather a pdf version of the book if they'd have one than going through the catastrophe which is publisher1. Also, the search feature which, otherwise would be useful, has massive bugs which makes it impossible to use. How slow this feature works is a joke, and the time for it to actually work takes way too long and is way too buggy.

I am a CIS major So I understand some of the challenges your technical teams are having when they are building a web interface for these books.  All my feedback was intended to be honest and constructive I don't intend for it to be Snarky..If e-books were easy everyone would be selling so please I provided this feedback with only constructive intentions not to tear anybody down or demean your product . 
I'm non traditional student and had high expectations when I put out the cost for a 1 year subscription.  I was excited because I could get E-books and text copy rentals at a good price.  Unfortunately after calling Product1 and finding out it is 1 rental  per semester I am a little concerned because I am struggling without the rentals. I have considered returning the this product 3-4 times and going to hard copies but hate the thought of only having a text copy because E-copies do have some advantages.        The Biggest problem has been lack of coordination between the bookstore, publisher1 and Red Shelf.  If my kid was going through all this I would have thought she was making it up. After working through the struggle I might not be willing to spend the money for this product on her behalf unless she absolutely wanted e-books because there is a lot that is challenging about your product.   If I compare your service to Amazon or Barnes and Noble (which I have used for years) I was never confronted with these kinds of issues.  Another thing that I find challenging is that the e-book search feature interfaces are different between my books the one book has a very clunky search feature  the other book seems to be more streamlined.   I also hate the fact that it is hard to get the page number and contents in either book.My teachers are assigning homework based on page numbers.   Initially I thought the pages in one book were showing incorrectly but That could have been user error on my part. In some cases the e-book interfaces are not as intuitive as they could be and are making it harder to work on my homework(Reading works great but flipping back and forth slows me down a little bit)    Compare that experience to using a pdf file where the pages are always right and you can use it between multiple devices with ease there are different ways to flip pages ( I feel like pdfs are designed a little more intuitively.  I know that for copyright reasons you are trying to keep the PDF files out of the hands of pirates but as paying customer the experience would be more consistent and familiar which would  ultimately have made me a lot happier. Hopefully my feedback is valuable to you.   I don't hate your product but I don't love it either.  If you were to ask me would I recommend it to a friend -  I would if they really wanted E-books  but I would warn them that Support needs improvement and some of the books do not flow as smooth as they do with the NOOK or the Kindle but they are usable if you really had to rely upon them.  One last note If you can help me with my rental situation that would be great â€¦.Thanks for your time feel free to contact me:   email",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1-5,positive

It doesn't let me see the specific contents of each chapter such as the end of chapter glossary unless I go to the book through the assignments otherwise on the book it just goes by chapter but it won't allow you to see all of the sections and content it contains. It's sooooo frustrating I hate this program. It's so much easier to use connect to read and highlight. This program makes it harder to have all highlighting stay put. Not to mention the app has less options for usage compared to the book. The worst part is reading or scrolling through the book is once again not showing contents of chapter on the app. I'm not going to click through each page in the computer or scroll through the whole chapter just to find the vocab list at the end or any of the review.,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1-5,negative

I carefully followed the instructions, but it did not work.  So I called to get tech support. The wait times are super long.  And every time I called, I heard something new that conflicted with what the previous rep told me.   Same is true for other questions I've had.  (Same is true of faculty & staff at my school)  They don't know that they are suppose to provide us with links, nor how to provide us with links. So we can't use the offline feature I was promised.  The other students don't know either.  Nobody is sure about how it works. 

After numerous calls & long wait times, I get help in finding, selecting & uploading my books to ""My Home"".  

But when I was ready to do my homework in the middle of the night, all my books had disappeared from my account!  When I searched for them to reselect & re-add to my account, I either couldn't find the books, or I could see the title & image of the book, but couldn't select it to load to ""My Home"".  It's been a confusing & challenging experience.  

Also, some of the books disappeared from my platform1 account.  And although I have now re-uploaded the books, it does not recognize that I re-loaded the last book.  It is not obvious how to add the book to platform1 Account from my phone.  I pressed all the buttons, one add a time, but can't figure it out (I pretty computer savvy/use them all day long).  I'm resisting the long wait times for tech support, so i still need help downloading the book to my account on platform1. 

But I like the idea of publisher1, in theory.  Getting started & stability - a nightmare!  

But I love the ReadSpeaker feature.  Extremely helpful, except if you are taking notes & want to go back &  repeat something, you can't go backwards. 

My experience with the Tech Support was good - warm, willingness to help & professionalism, but It just feels like they are not trained well. They don't really know the system well. ",0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,6-8,positive

She was nice and claimed to have the solution. She was supposed to call me back to get my order complete. She never did. It's almost impossible to get anyone on the phone. I understand that the fall semester, beginning of school year is a busy time. But maybe seasonal workers could be hired to help with the influx of calls because nobody likes a 45 minute wait time or hearing ""your call is important to us, we are currently experiencing a higher than normal volume of calls"", especially after trying to resolve the same issue for days. It's cliche and annoying. Be different publisher1! Be the change we need to see in the world! I finally got my book after forever, just a few days before the test. On a positive note, I appreciate that I can easily print the pages in the ebook without any screenshotting or super tiny fonts or hassle -way better than publisher3.

This was exacerbated when I contacted Red Shelf and they provide a phone number that says you must basically use an email if you want any support. Then When Red Shelf Support directed me to you directly it made it worse.  Also when looking into my rentals, I was not given a clear answer by anyone on what or how that process looks  so I called Product1 it was only then when I called Product1 that I found out that publisher1 UNLIMITTED provides 1 discounted rental with Product1 and the rest would be full price rentals.  I feel your Poster in my bookstore mis represented that fact as I was under the impression that purchasing publisher1 UNLIMITTED would get me discount rentals for all 4 of my classes which I was told is not the case.  1 discount rental per semester is all that Product1 is offering but I still can't get that rental because my school has not setup itself up correctly...

Most likely it is an encoding issue when displaying the text and is easy to fix but since it has not been fixed in a semester I wouldnt hold my breath. Also platform1 books dont have page numbers (dont know whats up with that). If you want to know what makes a learning platform good. Take a look at hawks learning. For math it is 100x better than anything you guys have made becuase of how they ensure that you have learned the lesson. While For these books its just that a book not a learning platform. You guys are litterally doing the bare-minimum and in some cases cant even meet that. Improve the books and the learning platform and then maybe you have an ok product. Now divide the price of all books by at least 2. Then maybe you have a good learning platform.

After speaking with Dept head, the instructors did create dummy courses for the key.  Needing 4 books to cover my 5 courses, I ordered the print copies through Product1.  Product1 canceled one book saying it was a second book for 1 course and that I couldn't do that, any further questions, speak with publisher1.  Funny enough, I was on the phone with publisher1 the second time I was communicating with Product1, and publisher1 had no issues with my courses or books.  After 2 hours on the phone with ya'lls poor Tamara--who was very nice--she sent me to Vicky who then sent me the loose leaf version to keep for the $7.99 price.  So, even though you guys did nothing wrong, you still made it right for me- and I greatly appreciate that.  Product1 though, somehow that process definitely needs to improve.",0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,9-10,positive

14288,R_2qaSuT9bFwK1o31,2018-11-18 17:23:00,4,"The structure of the ACCT 101A course does not set the student up for success, but failure. Each chapter is split up into three parts, a pre-lecture which introduces general topics of the chapter prior to the class meeting, a homework section which takes the longest of the three that focuses on a few elements of the chapter, and a cumulative exam. The pre-lecture and the exam can only be attempted once. The homework can be attempted 5 times. The content of the pre-lectures are accompanied by video tutorials and learning objectives, but since the concepts in the new chapter are just being introduced, mistakes can still be made. I am not certain why the pre-lectures are not given the same amount of attempts as the homework for the chapter. The homework is split up into several parts. Each part has an accompanying video tutorial through the first few chapters. Eventually, the video tutorials become less frequent the student is forced to depend on class notes and textbook resources in order to succeed. The textbook resources are far less specific and far more general in demonstrating the desired task, reducing the success of the student. There is also a ""check my work"" option that tells the student which prompts they got correct/incorrect. This is a fickle option as if the page accidentally reloads or if the student spends enough time looking at other questions in the homework, the input on what they got correct/incorrect disappears. I had several times where I would look back to another question to check if my method was the same for a similar problem only to find that the feedback for the entire problem disappeared. This reduced my feedback opportunities by one. The chapter exams have several problems. The question number is arbitrarily set to 20. The time is arbitrarily set to one hour. Some chapters cover subjects that take far less than an hour to complete, others have questions that can only be answered after doing several steps of calculations which take a considerable amount of time. Additionally the questions in the exam deal with both working through problems and answering short multiple choice questions. The only source of the answer for these multiple choice questions are from the pre-lecture, in-class lectures, and the extra practice problems that publisher1 does not require. The majority of each exam explores concepts students are not required to learn or merely briefly looked over. The homework hardly prepares the students for the exam. Finally, the timer is sometimes inconsistent. I've had 2 exams where it stopped me from working and said that time expired when the timer displayed 20 minutes remaining. Finally, publisher1 allows no late work instead of some form of grade reduction. This screws over students who are working to make a living while at school who have very brief windows of time to get things done. If something like the internet goes out after a time where they can go use public internet somewhere, they are screwed out of points that they could have gotten and would have gotten had the issue not occurred. The student then gets no credit for an entire week of homework when they could get partial credit for a more reasonable late work system such as -10% every day an assignment is late.

If these issues were fixed, I think publisher1 would be a wonderful standard for online homework based on the content itself. As is, it sets the student up for failure by not requiring practice with what they need to know for each exam, and it is plagued with technical glitches that reduce the amount of points a student can earn if they occour.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1-5,negative

I do hope to see some videos with specific how to demonstrations because their are tons of posts i see in forums through my canvas site of those who actually have no idea of what they are really doing. But other than that glad that all my course materials were able to be fulfilled here through your company publisher1, and I will say that the year subscription through your site specifically saved me tons of money this new semester and I still have a bit of ways to go before my year runs out. So thank you a bunch because I was able to spoil my kids for last years christmas with student credit card and this semester got to pay back more than half of that just due to the amount saved on materials needed for my classes this spring semester. So again thank you so much for that now just extra helps with login for new students or for new or extra materials courses we take if we do publisher1 subscriptions vs. publisher1 required course subscriptions via school req. 
Thank you and hope that my feedback helps.",0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,9-10,positive

Fewer people are attending colleges, most for financial reasons. Imagine the advantage a school would have if they could advertise that each year students pay a flat fee of less then $200 for all their books. I also believe the publisher2 monopoly has to end. I just finished a semester assisting a professor and we discovered that the publisher2 text book and materials she used had no flow, similar topics were all over the chapter so you needed to jump back in forth, there were also topics that needed to be taught together, but instead they were presented in different sections of the book. The worst issue was the quiz bank, the questions were developed to trick the students by changing only one word and some of the topics were never even covered in the current chapter. Students need to be encouraged by working hard and doing well on their exams, publisher2â€™s quiz bank is made up of poorly written questions that only frustrate the students.
